TODO:

* port over search logic centralisation commit from linear_hash
* we also want a ls_set (regardless of ls_exists)
* consider removing dummy(s) here too
* profile and compare: (1) original, (2) centralisation, (3) centralised without dummys
* document all the crazy in test_linear_set.c
* consider abstracting calloc calls
* consider allowing a compile option to cause allocs to fail for testing
* add support for common set operations (union, intersection, contains_set)
